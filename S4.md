# Step 4: Enhance with HTMX
We now have a working form with a confirmation step.
However, the experience isn't very modern.
The entire page reloads when we click Confirm or Submit.
We have to go back in our browser if we want to modify our form data after previewing it.

Let's fix that with HTMX.

## Why HTMX is great

Take a look at the `contact_page.html`

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <form action="/confirm/" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_div }}
        <button>
            <input type="submit" value="Confirm">
        </button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```
Right now, the 'action' and 'method' are set to the `<form>` tag.
That's normal because in traditional HTML, only forms and links can send HTTP requests.

HTMX upgrades and completes HTML as a hypertext. With HTMX, 

1. _Any_ HTML element to make an HTTP request.
2. _All_ events to trigger HTTP requests, not just clicks and submits.
3. _All_ HTTP request methods are available in HTML.
4. You are free to replace arbitrary elements in the HTML (you don't have to replace the whole screen).

It's a huge upgrade, but doesn't come at the cost of complexity and fragility inherent in other Javascript frameworks like React.
It also allows us to build our sites in our choice of web framework backends (like Django or Ruby on Rails).
We aren't forced to code our front and back ends in Javascript.

I've said enough, grug brother. Let's get coding.

## Add HTMX to `contact_page.html`

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<!-- Remove method and action attributes, add id -->
    <form id="contact-form">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_div }}
        <button hx-post="/confirm/"
                hx-target="#contact-form"
                hx-swap="outerHTML">
            <input type="submit" value="Confirm">
        </button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```
`hx-post` and `hx-target` are HTMX attributes.
`hx-post` is like a combination of the `action` and `method` attributes.
It says that a POST HTTP request should be sent to "/confirm/".
When HTMX makes the request to the server, `hx-swap` tells
HTMX to replace the 'outerHTML' of `hx-target` with the content at "/confirm/".
That just means all of this code will be replaced with the contents of `confirm_page.html`.

Save and try the form out. It should be pretty fast as usual. 
The experience might not feel different yet. But look at the URL on the confirm page:

`127.0.0.1:8000`, not `127.0.0.1:8000/confirm/`. We stay on the contact page.

But, when we try to submit, it breaks. The Django console says that the POST method isn't allowed.
This is the same error you would get if you tried to implement a confirmation page using a regular view,
rather than using formtools `FormPreview` class.

If we go back in the browser, we can actually reach the confirm page and click 'Send'.
Yep, things are definitely broken.
