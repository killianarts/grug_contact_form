# Step 2: Django Form
After setting up the GRUG stack environment, let's first get a page up and running.

## Create view: `ContactPageView`

Open `core/views.py`. Erase everything and add this:

```python
from django.views.generic import TemplateView

class ContactPageView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'base.html'
```

We're using the TemplateView class-based generic view.

Usually the `base.html` template won't be used directly. 

For now, we just want to check that everything is working fine.

## Add urls entries

In the `core` folder, make a file called `urls.py` and open it. Add the following:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import ContactPageView

urlpatterns = [
    path('', ContactPageView.as_view(), name='contact_page'),
]
```

Open `contact/urls.py`. Modify `urlpatterns`:

```python
## Add the 'core' app 'urls.py' to the routing path.
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path("__reload__/", include("django_browser_reload.urls")),
    path('', include('core.urls')),
]
```

## Start your engines
We are ready to test to see if Tailwind is working.

Start the development server:
`python manage.py runserver`

Start Tailwind:
`python manage.py tailwind start`

Open `127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser. If everything works, you should see a page with the following:

`Django + Tailwind = ❤️`

## Create a template for `ContactPageView`
Like I said before, we usually don't use the `base.html` file directly. Instead, we create a Django template block that we extend later.

In `theme/templates`, open a new file called `contact_page.html` and add the following:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Hello from contact_page.html!</h1>
{% endblock %}
```

## Modify `ContactPageView`
Set the template for `ContactPageView` to `contact_page.html`

```python
# core/views.py
class ContactView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'contact_page.html'
```

## Modify `base.html`
Remove the contents inside the `<body>` tag and add the following:

```html
<main id="main">
    {% block content %}{% endblock content %}
</main>
```

Save everything and the page should refresh (thanks, `django_browser_refresh`). At the very top left, it should read:

> Hello from contact_page.html!

## Understanding Django URLs and Templates
When we go to `127.0.0.1:8000`, Django looks at `contact/urls.py` and finds that the index (the '' in path('', ...)) refers to `core/urls.py`.

In `core/urls.py`, the index is set to `ContactPageView.as_view()`. 

The template for the view is `contact_page.html`, so Django looks in there.

`{% extends 'base.html' %}` tells Django that `contact_page.html` _inherits_ everything in the `base.html`.

`base.html` includes a Django template block, `{% block content %}{% endblock %}`. 
When a template extends `base.html` and includes a `{% block content %}{% endblock %}` block of its own, 
the contents inside that block will be sent to `base.html` and everything will be loaded up.

Any time you make a view for a new page, its template needs to include at least the following:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    Your page content will go in here.
{% endblock %}
```

Understanding Django's template inheritance is important for this project.

This contact form will use HTMX to replace elements in the HTML (rather than replacing the whole page). 

In Django terms, we will be using template 'partials' to replace parts of a base contact form template.

Now that we have a page that we can look at, let's set up our contact form.
There are two parts to our form: The Django Form class and the form template.
Let's start with the Django form.

## Building a Django form
Open a new file in the `core` directory called `forms.py` and insert the following:

```python
from django import forms


class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    sender_email = forms.EmailField()
    message = forms.CharField()
```

Then, edit the `ContactPageView`:

```python
# Add ContactForm import
from .forms import ContactForm
from django.views.generic.edit import FormView

class ContactPageView(FormView):
    template_name = 'contact_page.html'
    base_template = 'contact_form_partial.html'
    form_class = ContactForm
    success_url = '/confirm/'
```

In the `contact_page.html` template, delete everything inside the `contents` block and insert this:

```html
{{ form }}
```

Now view `127.0.0.1:8000` You should see three forms with labels `Name`, `Sender email`, and `Message`.

## Understanding Django Widgets
Let's take a look at the HTML in the browser dev tools:

```html
<main>
        <label for="id_name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" required="" id="id_name">
        <label for="id_sender_email">Sender email:</label>
        <input type="email" name="sender_email" required="" id="id_sender_email">
        <label for="id_message">Message:</label>
        <input type="text" name="message" required="" id="id_message">
</main>
```
We can see that Django has done a lot of work for us already.

- Every `<input>` field has a `<label>`.
- Every `<label>` has a `for` attribute set based on the name of the variable name in our `ContactForm` class.
- Every `<input>` has an `id` attribute corresponding to the `for` attribute in the `<label>` above.
- The `<input>` `type` attributes are set. Notice that the `<input>` named `sender_email` has a `type` set to 'email'.

The `CharField` and `EmailField` form field by default has this label/input template set up in this way. 
Those templates are Django widgets.

## Customizing our form

I don't want the email `<label>` to be 'Sender email'. I can change the label in `sender_email` form field definition.

```python
    # Add "label='Email'" to EmailField
    sender_email = forms.EmailField(label='Email')
```
Save the document and look at the page again. The `<label>` text is now 'Email'.

On a wide screen, the form fields are placed together horizontally. I want them to be vertical.
Edit the `contact_page.html` template:

```html
<!-- contact_page.html -->
{{ form.as_div }}
```
Save and reload. Now they are stacked vertically. Look at the HTML in devtools:

```html
<main>
    <div>
        <label for="id_name">Name:</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" required="" id="id_name">
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="id_sender_email">Email:</label>
        <input type="email" name="sender_email" required="" id="id_sender_email">
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="id_message">Message:</label>
        <input type="text" name="message" required="" id="id_message">
    </div>
</main>
```
Now each form field is surrounded with `<div>` tags.

The 'message' field is very small. The `CharField` input type is 'text' by default.
We want to use an HTML `textfield` type for the input. Django lets us customize the widget in the form field definition.

In `forms.py`:

```python
class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField()
    sender_email = forms.EmailField(label='Email')
    # Add "widget=forms.Textarea"
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
```
Save and view the page. View the HTML in the devtools:

```html
<div>
    <label for="id_message">Message:</label>
    <textarea name="message" cols="40" rows="10" required="" id="id_message"></textarea>
</div>
```
The `<input>` tag has been replaced with a `<textarea>` tag with `cols` and `rows` set for us automatically. Nice.

We'll work more on customizing the form fields. 
But first, Django doesn't add a form tag, submit button, or csrf token for us, so let's add them.

```html
<!-- contact_page.html -->
<form action="/confirm/" method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_div }}
    <button>
        <input type="submit" value="Confirm">
    </button>
</form>
```
The CSRF token is a security measure used by Django to prevent certain kinds of hacking.
It needs to be present in all Django forms.

Save the template and view the page. Now you should see 'Confirm' below the form fields. 
Doesn't look like a button yet, but we'll get to that.

We've essentially completed the form building part of our project.
In the next part, we are going to add a confirmation step.
