# Step 3: Adding confirmation step
We want a confirmation step for our contact form.
That involves adding some new views and templates.
But first, lets look at the form one more time.

## About the form

```html
<!-- theme/templates/contact_page.html -->
    <form action="/confirm/" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_div }}
        <button>
            <input type="submit" value="Confirm">
        </button>
    </form>
```
`method="post"` means that the browser will send a POST HTTP request.
That means that there is some data being sent.

`action="/confirm"` means that Django will route the request to the view that has been assigned that address.
We'll update the `urls.py` in a minute. 
But first, we want to make an 'action' for this form to perform.
Unfortunately, we can't simply add a new view with the form data.
Instead, we need to install and use a Django utility app that will give us the confirmation step functionality we want.

## Install `django-formtools`
Install is easy.

`pip install django-formtools`

In `settings.py`, add formtools to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    'core',
    'django_htmx',
    'tailwind',
    'widget_tweaks',
    'theme',
    'django_browser_reload',
    'formtools'
]
```

Now, let's work on the view

```python
# core/views.py

# Add to the top
from formtools.preview import FormPreview

class ContactDataPreview(FormPreview):
    
    def done(self, request, cleaned_data):
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('success_page'))
```

We are using formtools FormPreview class to make this view.
When a user clicks the 'Confirm' button of the contact form,
they will be sent to the default template formtools provides.
Give it a shot. It's quite a mess. Let's fix it up by adding our own template.

## Add `confirmation_page.html` template
In `theme/templates`, open a new template called `confirmation_page.html`.

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    {% for field in form %}
    <div>
        {{ field.label }}:
        {{ field.value }}
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endblock %}
```

Remember, `form` is an instance of `ContactForm` that includes our submitted data.
We added it to the 'context' dictionary when we added the line 
`context['form'] = ContactForm()` to the `get_context_data()` 
method of the `ContactView` class.
This template loops through the fields in the form,
then displays the field label _string_ (not the `<label>` tag)
and field's value (also string).

Let's also add the template to the `ContactDataPreview` view:

```python
class ContactDataPreview(FormPreview):
    # Add this.
    preview_template = 'confirmation_page.html'

    def done(self, request, cleaned_data):
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('success_page'))
```

## Add entry in `urls.py`
Update the `urls.py` file:

```python
# core/urls.py

# Add to top
from .forms import ContactForm
from .views import ContactView, ContactDataPreview

urlpatterns = [
    path('', ContactView.as_view(), name='contact_page'),
    # Add this line. Notice that we need an 'as_view()' at the end.
    # Formtools takes care of that for us.
    # We just need to specify which form we are using for the view.
    path('confirm/', ContactDataPreview(ContactForm)),
]
```

Let's just recap a bit. Look at the form template again:

```html
<!-- theme/templates/contact_page.html -->
<form action="/confirm/" method="post">
```

When the form is submitted, Django will look at urlpatterns to find the right 'action' to take.
'confirm' refers to the `ContactDataPreview`, so it will run that 'action'.

## Test the confirmation
Save everything and reload the form page (if you don't, you might be using the old template).

Add some data. See what happens if you don't put in an email address? 
Django knows that an email wasn't input and won't let you submit the form.

Now try putting in a valid email address and submit. I got this:

> Name: test 
> Email: test@test.com 
> Message: test

Okay, looks fine. We'll worry about styling it later.

## Update template
Next, we need to be able to actually submit the form.
Let's update the template.

```html
<!-- confirmation_page.html -->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    {% for field in form %}
    <div>
        {{ field.label }}:
        {{ field.value }}
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
<!-- Added form, csrf token, hidden fields for some reason, and button -->
    <form action="" method="post">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {% for field in form %}
            {{ field.as_hidden }}
        {% endfor %}
        <input type="hidden" name="{{ stage_field }}" value="2" />
        <input type="hidden" name="{{ hash_field }}" value="{{ hash_value }}" />
        <button>
            <input type="submit" value="Send" />
        </button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

Things are getting hairy, grug brother.

I copy and pasted this added portion from the default formtools `preview.html` template.
You need a `<form>` tag to make a form, and a `<input type="submit">` tag for submitting.
I don't know what the hidden fields are for, but I guess it's
for validation.

When the form is first filled out and the 'Confirm' button is clicked,
`ContactDataPreview` will show the above template.
When the 'Send' button is clicked, it will return to the `ContactDataPreview` view,
and then it will run the `done` method.

Right now, it's just set to redirect to a success page. 
Let's make that next so we can test everything out.

## Add `SuccessView` and `success_page.html` template
Add the `SuccessView`.
```python
# core/views.py
class SuccessView(TemplateView):
    template_name = 'success_page.html'
```
It's nearly identical to the `ContactView` class, 
again using the generic class-based TemplateView.

Now for the template, `success_page.html`
```html
<!-- theme/templates/success_page.html -->
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <h1>Complete</h1>
{% endblock %}
```
When the 'Send' button on the confirmation page is clicked,
the `done` method of `ContactDataPreview` is run.
It redirects to the `SuccessView`, which uses the above template.

## Add `SuccessView` to `urls.py`

```python
# core/urls.py
    path('', ContactView.as_view(), name='contact_page'),
    path('confirm/', ContactDataPreview(ContactForm)),
    # Add this
    path('success/', SuccessView.as_view(), name='success_page')
```


Save everything and refresh the form.
Try submitting some data. You'll get a preview at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/confirm/` and a 'Send' button.
If you click the 'Send' button, you will go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/success/`

## Sending an email with `ContactDataPreview`
We're getting near the end here. We just need to be able to actually send an email when we click 'Send'.

Usually, you need to set an email username, password, host, etc.
For our purposes, we just want to pretend to send an email.
To do that, we can use the `console` Django email backend.

Open `settings.py` and add the following line:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

When we submit the form and click 'Send', Django will run a simulation of sending an email.
It will show the email in the console.

Now, go back to `views.py` and modify it as follows:

```python
# Django provides a helper function for sending email. Let's use it.
from django.core.mail import send_mail

class ContactDataPreview(FormPreview):
    preview_template = 'confirmation_page.html'

    def done(self, request, cleaned_data):
        # The done method includes our form's cleaned_data.
        sender_name = cleaned_data['name']
        sender_email = cleaned_data['sender_email']
        message = cleaned_data['message']
        send_mail(  # Subject line
                    f'{sender_name} - {sender_email}',
                    # Message body
                    message,
                    # From: email.
                    'noreply@killianarts.online',
                    # List of recipients
                    ['contact@killianarts.online'],
                  )
        return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('success_page'))
```

Save and retry the form. You should be able to reach the success page.
In the console, you should see something like this:

```
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Subject: Micah - micah@killianarts.online
From: noreply@killianarts.online
To: contact@killianarts.online

test message

[18/Aug/2022 05:13:56] "GET /success/ HTTP/1.1" 200 777
```

You can see that a POST request was sent to `/confirm/` 
and then you were redirected to `/success/` via a GET request.

## Hey, wait a second...
You may have noticed something: No HTMX.

You have successfully implemented a contact form that includes a confirmation step without HTMX.
Right now, advancing through the form process involves server-side calls to grab our templates and render them. 
That means a flash of white and reload of all the page assets every time we move to the next step.
We also need to press the browser's Back button if we want to go from the confirmation view back to the contact page view.
It works, but people expect a more seamless experience.

On a modern website, usually this is handled with Javascript.
Complex libraries like React are used to create Single Page Applications (SPAs),
and those applications will handle everything on the client side.
It's nice, but for such a simple application like a contact form, wouldn't it be nice to have a simple Javascript library to help us out?

There is, and it's called HTMX. In the next part of this guide, we will reimplement the form using HTMX.
