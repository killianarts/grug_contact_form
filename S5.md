# Styling the GRUG contact form with TailwindCSS
Now that we have our contact form working, let's make it look good.

We are going to see several huge benefits to Tailwind in our contact form.

- No names in HTML. No worrying about what your component 'is'.
- No problems dealing with CSS inheritance. Modifications you make on an element stay on that element only. No surprises!
- Making, sharing, and reusing components and templates is easy.
- Fast development thanks to design system.

Naming is hard. If you have one card with one set of styles, it's easy.
What if you have several cards with different variations?
What if you make a new element that has shares some styles with cards,
but isn't strictly a card? What is a 'card'?

Tailwind frees you from naming so that you can just get to the styling.

Inheritance is hard. Because Tailwind styles are localized to the element they are set on,
you don't have to worry about your styles breaking other elements 
on other pages you didn't mean to edit.

Alright, enough talk. Let's get to work.

## The Design
I made a [design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/9jDAyd4vhgxcQE9FSsbPpq/GRUG%3A-Contact-Form?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=2%3A6&viewport=271%2C464%2C0.2&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=2%3A6) 
that we will use for the contact form.

I used a Figma plugin called Tailwind Color Palettes that imports the default
[Tailwind color palettes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) into 
your Figma file. My design uses the slate and cyan palettes.

## Add TailwindCSS to `contact_form.html`
Let's take our skeleton contact form and breathe some life into it.
Basic explanations are in the comments.

```html
<!-- contact_form.html -->
{% extends base_template %}
<!-- We need this for the warning_icon.svg file used in the error message. -->
{% load static %}
<!-- Django Widget Tweaks is a Django extension that allows us to stick to -->
<!-- the GRUG way of localizing our behavior. -->
<!-- Without it, we'd need to edit our form classes in our ContactForm -->
<!-- See the documentation here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/forms/widgets/#styling-widget-instances -->
{% load widget_tweaks %}

{% block contact_form %}
    <form class="container mx-auto px-5 pt-10 grid grid-cols-1 gap-5 max-w-3xl">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <!-- We can no longer use form.as_div because we need to be able to modify the styles and layout. -->
        <!-- Here we will insert any errors that aren't related to a particular field. -->
        {{ form.non_field_errors }}
        {% for field in form %}
            <div class="w-full">
                <!-- We wrap everything in a <label> tag to make the fields easier to select -->
                <!-- and so that we can style the label when we click inside the form field. -->
                <label for="{{ field.id_for_label }}"
                       class="block w-full text-slate-900 font-bold text-3xl cursor-pointer focus-within:text-cyan-500">
                    <!-- We can change the style of an element if the field has errors. -->
                    <p class="pb-2 {% if field.errors %} text-orange-600 {% endif %}">{{ field.label }}</p>
                    {% if field.errors %}
                        <!-- render_field is the template tag that django widget tweaks gives us.  -->
                        {% render_field field class="w-full bg-slate-200 font-normal text-xl text-slate-900 border-2 border-orange-600 focus:ring-0 focus:outline-0 focus:border-orange-600" %}
                        {% for error in field.errors %}
                            <div class="flex gap-2">
                                <img class="inline-block" src="{% static 'warning_icon.svg' %}">
                                <p class="text-orange-600 text-lg font-thin">{{ error|escape }}</p>
                            </div>
                        {% endfor %}
                    {% else %}
                        <!-- We make this fake, opacity: 0 error message to reserve space for our error message. -->
                        <!-- Without it, the fields will move if an error pops up. -->
                        {% render_field field placeholder=field.label class="w-full bg-slate-100 font-normal font-body text-xl text-slate-900 border-2 border-monochrome-100 focus:ring-0 focus:outline-0 focus:border-cyan-500" %}
                        <div class="flex gap-2 opacity-0">
                                <img class="inline-block" src="{% static 'warning_icon.svg' %}">
                                <p class="text-orange-600 text-lg font-thin">Error message</p>
                        </div>
                    {% endif %}
                </label>
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
        <button hx-post="confirm/"
                hx-target="#contact-form"
                hx-swap="outerHTML"
                class="max-w-fit mx-auto px-14 py-4 bg-cyan-600 text-slate-50 text-2xl transition ease-in-out duration-300 hover:bg-cyan-500">
            Confirm
        </button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```

There is a lot in here. If you're familiar with CSS, you probably can guess what most of the Tailwind classes are doing.
I will have a more thorough Tailwind guide in the future.

Learning Tailwind is easy. For now, just search [the Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
Try looking up some classes used above in the documentation to find out what they do.

The important thing to note is that our styles are completely localized to the elements they are set on.
We don't have a `.button` class for our button. We don't have a `.form-field` or `.form-field__error` class for our fields.

Many people worry about code duplication with Tailwind.
Notice that with Django templates, we can use `for` loops to loop through our form fields.
One set of styles applied once will apply to all of them.

The above code uses classes like `text-slate-900`, `bg-cyan-600`, etc.
`slate` and `cyan` are references to the default Tailwind color palette.
The number is the 'weight' of the color.
`text-slate-900` applies the color `slate-900` to the text (surprising, I know).
`bg-cyan-600` applies the color `cyan-600` to the background.
The color palette is [completely customizable](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors), but we won't be doing that for this project.

There is one bit of customization that we will do, though. We want to use a custom font, `JetBrains Mono`.

## Edit `tailwind.config.js` and add TailwindCSS to `base.html`

```js
// contact/theme/static_src/tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
...
    theme: {
        fontFamily: {
                'brains': ['"JetBrains Mono"'],
        },
    },
```

We also need to import the font from Google Fonts.

```html
<!-- base.html -->
<head>
    ...
    <style>
        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=JetBrains+Mono:wght@100;400;800&display=swap');
    </style>
</head>
```

With this bit of configuration, we can use the class `font-brains` to apply `font-family: "JetBrains Mono"` to any element.

In our case, everything uses JetBrains Mono, so let's just apply it to `<body>` tag in `base.html`.

```html
<!-- base.html -->
<body hx-headers='{"X-CSRFToken": "{{ csrf_token }}"}'
      class="bg-slate-100 font-brains">
```

We don't need to do any more styling in `base.html`. All of our fonts will now be JetBrains Mono.

Test it out. Try making an error message appear. Looking good.

Let's style the confirmation page.

```html
<!-- confirmation_page.html -->
{% extends base_template %}
{% load static %}
{% load widget_tweaks %}

{% block contact_form %}
    <form class="container mx-auto pt-10 px-5 max-w-3xl grid grid-cols-1 gap-10 text-slate-900">
    {% csrf_token %}
        <h3 class="mx-auto text-center text-3xl font-thin">
            Please Confirm
        </h3>
        {{ form.non_field_errors }}
        {% for field in form %}
            <div class="w-full">
                <label for="{{ field.id_for_label }}"
                       class="text-2xl">
                    <!-- This form field is hidden. We still need to have the form fields present in the form, but -->
                    <!-- we don't want to edit them here. -->
                    {{ field.as_hidden }}
                    <p class="max-w-fit font-bold text-cyan-600 pb-2">{{ field.label }}: </p>
                    <span>{{ field.value }}</span>
                </label>
            </div>
        {% endfor %}
        <div id="buttons" class="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-10">
            <button hx-target="#contact-form" hx-swap="outerHTML"
                    hx-post="send/"
                    <!-- Here we sneak in some _hyperscript. -->
                    <!-- See explanation below. -->
                    _="on click toggle .hidden on #indicator then remove #buttons"
                    class="max-w-fit px-14 py-4 bg-cyan-700 text-slate-100 text-2xl transition ease-in-out duration-300 hover:bg-cyan-600 cursor-pointer">
                Send
            </button>
            <button hx-target="#contact-form" hx-swap="outerHTML"
                    hx-post="/"
                    class="max-w-fit px-14 py-4 bg-slate-900 text-slate-100 text-2xl transition ease-in-out duration-300 hover:bg-slate-700 cursor-pointer">
                Edit
            </button>
        </div>

        <div id="indicator" class="hidden mx-auto">

```

Like the `contact_form.html` template, the TailwindCSS is fairly easy to understand.
There are two parts of this template I want to highlight.

When we move from the ContactPageView to the ConfirmationView, 
we send ContactPageView's form data inside the POST HTTP request
and then create a new form pre-filled with that data.
**That means that we also need to include the form field itself, even if we aren't going to modify it here.**
But, it doesn't need to be visible, so we include it here as `{{ field.as_hidden }}`.

I also snuck a little bit of _hyperscript in. Let's take a closer look.

## _hyperscript
We use HTMX when we need to make server requests. However, if we don't need to request any data from the server to modify
our HTML somehow, we can use another member of the GRUG stack: _hyperscript.

_hyperscript is a Javascript library that gives developers a declarative language to do simple Javascript operations.
We imported the library during the setup stage.

```html
<!-- base.html -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hyperscript.org@0.9.7"></script>
```

That's all we need in order to use it.

Let's take a look at the _hyperscript code in our template:

```html
<!-- Notice: <div> has id #buttons -->
<div id="buttons" class="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-10">
    <button hx-target="#contact-form" hx-swap="outerHTML"
            hx-post="send/"
            <!-- Here -->
            _="on click toggle .hidden on #indicator then remove #buttons"
            class="max-w-fit px-14 py-4 bg-cyan-700 text-slate-100 text-2xl transition ease-in-out duration-300 hover:bg-cyan-600 cursor-pointer">
        Send
    </button>
    <button hx-target="#contact-form" hx-swap="outerHTML"
            hx-post="/"
            class="max-w-fit px-14 py-4 bg-slate-900 text-slate-100 text-2xl transition ease-in-out duration-300 hover:bg-slate-700 cursor-pointer">
        Edit
    </button>
</div>
```

In the send button, we have the following _hyperscript code:

`_="on click toggle .hidden on #indicator then remove #buttons"`

On a development server, we probably won't see it.
Sending the email is too fast, so we never get to see the indicator.

However, on a production website, sending the email will take time. 
Without a visual indication that the page is doing something, when we press the send button, 
nothing will change until the `ConfirmationView` redirects to `SuccessView`, after the email is successfully sent.
That is confusing, so we need to provide a visual indication that something is happening.

Honestly, HTMX provides the ability to style indications using the `htmx-indicator` class, but I can't get it to work easily.
The _hyperscript code words perfectly and is easy to understand.

The #indicator houses the loading animation. By default, we have it set to `display: hidden` using the Tailwind class `hidden`.
When the user clicks the send button, 
it will remove the `hidden` class and then delete `<div id="buttons">`, where our buttons are.

## Add TailwindCSS to `success_view.html`
Finally, we just need to style `success_view.html`

```html
<div class="font-thin text-3xl container mx-auto grid place-items-center min-h-screen text-center text-slate-900">
    Email sent!
</div>
```

That's it. Our contact form is complete. We now have a simple, modern Hypermedia-Driven Application.
